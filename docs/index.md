# DNDSR Documentation

DNDSR is a C++17 / Python CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) research code
implementing Compact Finite Volume methods with MPI parallelism and optional
CUDA GPU support.

The [2026-10-31 VR SVD correction](dev/vr_svd_cutoff_2026-10-31.md) documents the
small-mode cutoff change, setup diagnostics and affected nonzero-tolerance cases.

The [2026-11-03 extended Euler rotation correction](dev/euler_extended_rotation_2026-11-03.md)
records the NS_EX/NS_EX_3D absolute-velocity source convention and focused tests.

The [Cauchy preliminary completion record](dev/cauchy_preliminary_2026-11-01.md)
records physical layouts, resident CUDA reconstruction, explicit device-packed
transfers, completed gates and performance limits.

The [NCCL/FP64 complement record](dev/nccl_fp64_2026-11-01.md) documents the
CUDA-default NCCL build option, explicit provider/kernel selection, final
distributed gates and the measured gains and regressions by shape.

## Architecture entry points

Cauchy development starts at the [solver contracts and ledger](architecture/Cauchy.md).
The [November 5 pMG and distributed-failure audit](dev/cauchy_pmg_distributed_errors_2026-11-05.md)
records the coarse-gradient correction, fail-fast boundary and publication checks.
The [multidomain input and restart guide](guides/cauchy_multidomain.md) gives the
configuration shape, CGNS/HDF loader boundaries and simulation archive layout.
The [equation-state contract](architecture/CauchyState.md) documents semantic
segments, shared storage, leases and explicit physical/backend dispatch.
The [physical state input guide](architecture/CauchyStateInput.md) specifies
Euler-compatible tagged inputs, unit scales and physical reference states.
The [native LVR guide](architecture/CauchyLimitedVR.md) documents penalty
ownership, sensor ordering, halo phases and warm-state restart semantics.
Native linear operators, Jacobian assembly, staged SGS and local ILU are described
in [Cauchy implicit operator contracts](architecture/CauchyImplicit.md).
The [boundary convention guide](architecture/CauchyBoundary.md) distinguishes
Euler exterior targets, conservative gradient traces, viscous wall laws,
farfield switching and approximate implicit boundary derivatives.
The [Cauchy positivity policy](architecture/CauchyPositivity.md) specifies
thermal constraints, component scopes and preserved Euler repair ordering.
The [Cauchy output contract](architecture/CauchyOutput.md) defines centralized
history, console, manifest, checkpoint/visualization naming and exact-time
snapping, including the explicit internal-checkpoint limitation.
The [Cauchy audit fix record](dev/cauchy_audit_fix.md) tracks the shared SST
blend correction and independent RANS reconstruction positivity policy.
The [plan 53 execution ledger](dev/plan53_audit_execution.md) reconciles those
commits with the remaining programming audit, UT consolidation and enhancements.
The initial CPU single-domain flow solver uses native CFV P3/WBAP; numerical
case qualification and implicit/physical multi-domain execution remain separate
gates. The placement foundation mock alone is not a fluid validation.

The mesh construction correction and its fixture/condition audit are recorded
in the validation ledger below. Earlier infrastructure acceptance was withdrawn
after detecting an omitted boundary ring; see the
[evidence correction](dev/infrastructure_finish_2026-10-27.md). Test totals and
owned numerical parity do not prove per-rank ghost completeness.
The [Runtime/mesh audit](dev/runtime_mesh_audit_2026-10-29.md) records the
abstraction and safety review, fixes, validation checkpoints and the completed
parallel setup median target; serial import and later FV work are separate.
The [2026-10-30 retrospective](dev/refactor_retrospective_2026-10-30.md) records
the next audit's local fixes, remaining design decisions, test limitations and
CFV/sliding-interface planning boundary. Earlier validation is not evidence for
these new changes.
The [accepted-fixes follow-up](dev/accepted_audit_fixes_2026-10-30.md) resolves
the field-layout and compiled-program decisions and records the next FV/Geom
work orders.
The [CPU FV/interface validation](dev/fv_interface_2026-10-30.md) records the
implemented numerical/geometric scope, focused tests and matched legacy VR
performance evidence.
The [2026-10-31 facility next steps](dev/facilities_next_steps_2026-10-31.md)
separates current DNDS/Geom/CFV support from accepted overlap, numerical and
distributed-interface work, including explicit deferred features.
The [source comparison and validation ledger](dev/mesh_construction_semantics_2026-10-28.md)
records the final checks, explicit legacy periodic-frame differences and limits.
The [legacy connectivity test-purpose ledger](dev/mesh_connectivity_test_port_2026-10-28.md)
records all 47 original cases, independent expected answers and explicit
replacements for retired containers.

The [2026-11-05 Euler gradient correction](dev/euler_gradient_buffers_2026-11-05.md)
documents limited-gradient preparation, explicit reuse and boundary-stage timing.

The [Euler RANS reconstruction PP correction](dev/euler_rans_reconstruction_pp_2026-11-05.md)
separates spatial flow beta from scalar limiting and preserves coupled increment scaling.

The [SST convergence audit](dev/euler_sst_convergence_2026-11-05.md)
records source linearization, wall perturbation checks and O2 numerical trials.

The [GG boundary-target correction](dev/euler_gg_boundary_targets_2026-11-05.md)
documents mutable wall traces, immutable means, preserved VR semantics and
EulerP scalar neighbour/boundary indexing.

> Python editable installs, external dependencies, and common issues).

## C++ API (Doxygen)

The Sphinx C++ API pages provide namespace outlines and key class documentation
via Breathe. For the full Doxygen HTML documentation with interactive
**call graphs**, **class inheritance diagrams**, and **include dependency graphs**,
build and serve the Doxygen output separately:

```sh
cmake --build build -t serve-doxygen
```

Once built, the full Doxygen reference is at
<a href="doxygen/index.html">Doxygen C++ API Reference</a> within the same site.
