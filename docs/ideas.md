# DNDSR Ideas

## Next Step:

- [x] wrap mesh for better access
- [ ] check dist topo and comm with a global BFS data
- [x] start CFV methods
- [ ] check on general json parsing
- [ ] octree and periodic bc (using CGAL)
- [ ] mesh reader: CGNS abutting interface with 1-to-1 face
- [ ] CFV limiters
- [ ] Euler Solver
