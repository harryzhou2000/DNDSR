    /** @brief Reusable preparation scratch, separate from frozen publications.
     * @details Usually two numerical slots suffice for evaluated storage: one
     * current publication and one being filled. A retained external publication
     * may keep a slot busy; another slot is allocated rather than overwritten.
     * Released slots are reused. Assembled mode needs only one slot. No engine
     * or stream is owned here; the enclosing domain context owns execution.
     * Persistent immutable read seals use the device's default context, not
     * the borrowed preparation stream, which can expire before this workspace.
     * Every asynchronous numerical use retains this object through completion;
     * the seals are ownership/exclusion guards, not completion proofs for those
     * uses. Placement completes before these immutable views are published.
