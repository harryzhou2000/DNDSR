    /** @brief Managed nonlinear arithmetic on one ordered execution stream.
     * @details This operator layer owns only immutable metrics/policies and
     * reusable bounded reduction scratch. It never owns the evolving solution
     * or commits a candidate. Submission retains every Array/metadata owner;
     * CPU-inline, CPU-worker and CUDA use the same controller call sequence.
     * Numerical leaves take views and POD policies, without MPI or leases.
     *
     * Methods returning host values explicitly drain the engine before reading
     * compact summaries. These are nonlinear acceptance/convergence boundaries,
     * not per-cell waits. Submit* methods only enqueue, and their consumer must
     * order or observe that prefix. No MPI reduction is performed here; the
     * controller aggregates on the domain communicator. CUDA currently accepts
     * combined AoS perfect-gas flow5/SA/2EQ, while CPU retains generic layouts
     * and mixture policies. A workspace is serialized on its bound stream.
