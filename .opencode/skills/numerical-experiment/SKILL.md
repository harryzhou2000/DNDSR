# Numerical Experiment

Produce reproducible numerical evidence without allowing exploratory runs to become unbounded or raw output to pollute the tracked research record.

## Required Inputs

Before launching a numerical case, establish all four inputs:

- `runner`: `local` or an identified remote machine;
- allocation: MPI rank count `np` or an explicit CPU-usage limit;
- direction: the numerical question, hypothesis, or comparison;
- `workspace_name`: the experiment repository at `<repo>/workspace/<workspace_name>`.

If runner or allocation is absent, proceed with planning, source inspection, existing-data analysis, and dry-run preparation, but do not launch a solver. Ask for the missing execution input at the next meaningful run boundary rather than blocking earlier useful work.

Read [references/experiment_protocol.md](references/experiment_protocol.md) before creating the workspace or launching, monitoring, modifying, or reporting an experiment.

## Core Workflow

1. Verify the repository root, applicable `AGENTS.md`, current Git status, available build, case path conventions, and whether `.codegraph/` requires CodeGraph-first navigation.
2. Create or reuse `<repo>/workspace/<workspace_name>` as an independent Git repository, never a DNDSR submodule. Preserve any existing workspace contents and history.
3. Record the experiment plan before execution: hypothesis, controls, observables, runner/allocation, time budget, stopping conditions, raw-output paths, and tracked derived artifacts.
4. Establish the cheapest discriminating trial first. Estimate wall time from a prior comparable run or a short timed pilot.
5. Make configuration changes in place with the editing tool. Preserve JSON notes and comments; never rewrite maintained configs with `json.dump`.
6. Build only required targets. For Python tests after C++ changes, rebuild and install every required pybind11 target before testing, as required by the repository instructions.
7. Launch only after the input contract is complete. Record the exact command, runner, allocation, source state, config snapshot/hash, start time, and expected stop time.
8. Monitor long expected runs with Luna or the user's specified available low-cost model. Monitoring observes progress and enforces stop conditions; it does not silently alter the experiment.
   The primary agent may wait up to 10 minutes for the polling subagent to return when the numerical run has the same bounded duration.
9. Fetch only compact post-processed lines, profiles, critical-point data, tables, and plots into the workspace. Keep ordinary raw numerical output under `<repo>/data/...` according to config conventions.
10. Validate numerical plausibility and compare against the stated reference or invariant. Report verified results separately from partial, failed, or unrun work.

## Non-Negotiable Bounds

- A normal end-to-end trial that produces numerical results must be designed to finish within 10 minutes.
- Bound total work with physical `nTimeStep` or final time and with pseudo/internal step caps. Also set convergence thresholds and output cadence deliberately.
- Never extrapolate a short pilot into a claimed result. Mark pilots as pilots.
- Do not start, stop, restart, or repair unrelated services.
- Do not commit, push, create PRs, or mutate remote Git state without the authorization required by repository policy.
- Do not discard user changes. Check status before branch, stash, restore, or checkout operations.

## When a Trial Is Too Slow

Use the protocol's adaptation order and record each change. Prefer more cores when scaling is credible. A smaller mesh is acceptable without asking only for simple reproducible geometry; ask the user before simplifying complex geometry. Coarser physical steps, mesh coarsening, relaxed internal thresholds, internal-step caps that stop before threshold, and CFL tuning can change accuracy or numerical behavior, so treat each as an experimental factor and re-establish result quality.

## Completion Standard

The experiment is complete only when another researcher can identify the exact source/config state, reproduce the command on the stated runner/allocation, locate raw and tracked artifacts, understand runtime bounds, and distinguish the observation from its interpretation and limitations.
